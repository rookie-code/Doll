## Setup

After downloading place the DCMotorBot folder inside your Arduino's library folder

Connect the DC motors to Arduino using H-Bridge IC like L293D. 

You can find a copy of L293D's [datasheet](datasheet/l293d.pdf) and [pin out diagram](datasheet/l293d-pinout.png) inside in the /datasheet directory

The following is the pin out diagram of the IC.
